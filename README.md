# IMPORTING into LNM
You can import these CSV files into LittleNavMap via the import Userpoints feature in LNM.
If you see an error importing any CSV file, close LNM and reimport the file. LNM seems to have a bug on the import feature that throws an error.

# UPDATING previous routes
 *** When updating LNM with an updated route, please delete previous points by searching for the CAM route(s) pior to updating or you will have duplicate data points.****
